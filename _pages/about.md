# About Me


Hi, here is **Zhjian Lai (Galvin, 赖志坚)**. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at [Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering](https://www.sie.tsukuba.ac.jp/eng/), [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) and I am taking the [Doctoral Programs in Policy and Planning Sciences](https://www.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/PPS/en/). 

My supervisor is [Prof. Akiko Yoshise](https://infoshako.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/~yoshise/). We are team PhilOpt )))). 

**<span style="color:red">[New!]</span>** Starting in May 2024, I'll be joining [Zaiwen Wen](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/)'s group at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)'s [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR)](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/) as a postdoc.


## Research Interests

- Nonsmooth Optimization, Riemannian Optimization, Geodesic Convex Optimization
- Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Quantum Interior Point Methods
- Bilevel Optimization, Multi-objective Optimization

## Agenda

 - From 2024.03.05 to 2024.04.10, I am a research visitor in [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR)](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/).


## News and Updates

- **[2024.03.04]** My new paper has published in *Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications*. Please click here: [Riemannian Interior Point Methods for Constrained Optimization on Manifolds.]( https://doi.org/10.1007/s10957-024-02403-8)

- **[2024.01.22]** Today, I finished the final defense [(slides)](https://galvinlai.github.io/files/slides/2024_01_22_PhD_FinalDefense.pdf) of my PhD. I am very thankful to Prof. Yoshise for her guidance over the past five years. I also appreciate the valuable suggestions that Prof. Sato provided for my thesis.
