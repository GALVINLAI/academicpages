# About Me


Hi, here is **Zhjian Lai (Galvin, 赖志坚)**. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at [Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering](https://www.sie.tsukuba.ac.jp/eng/), [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) and I am taking the [Doctoral Programs in Policy and Planning Sciences](https://www.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/PPS/en/). 

My supervisor is [Prof. Akiko Yoshise](https://infoshako.sk.tsukuba.ac.jp/~yoshise/). We are team PhilOpt )))). 

<font color='red'>Right now I'm actively looking for a postdoctoral position.</font> 

## Research Interests

- Nonsmooth Optimization, Riemannian Optimization, Geodesic Convex Optimization
- Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Quantum Interior Point Methods
- Bilevel Optimization, Multi-objective Optimization

## Agenda

<font color='red'>Currently, I will participate in the following events:</font> 

 - The 10th [International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM)](https://iciam2023.org/). 
	Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, August 20-25, 2023. 
	I will give a talk [here](https://iciam2023.org/registered_data?id=01064).
	
	ICIAM 2023 Tokyo is surprisingly large. The [official website](https://iciam2023.org/accepted_ms) only provides a web version of the program for online browsing, in which the details of each session need to be opened one by one to view.
	For the convenience of globally searching program information in one go, I have created the PDF files containing all the information. This way, you can directly search for keywords within the PDF file.

	Feel free to download the following files for your convenience:\
	[Minisymposia Programs](https://galvinlai.github.io/files/ICIAM2023_whole_program/whole_program_minisymposia.pdf)\
	[Contributed Talks Programs](https://galvinlai.github.io/files/ICIAM2023_whole_program/whole_program_contributed_talks.pdf)
